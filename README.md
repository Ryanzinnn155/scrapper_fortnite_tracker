<h1>Fortnite Tracker Table Collector</h1>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>This code collecting data only from SOLOS championships! it works in a very simple way, first you will provide the link you want to collect the data from the table, like session 2 of the "Playstation Cup", with this it will enter the Fortnite Tracker with the link for that championship and session, and will start to collect the data.</p>


<h3>How Scrapper works</h3>
<p>Scrapper works as follows, it accesses the link provided as a parameter and the total number of pages it will collect data from, and will collect data from the page and return.
The collector sends the data to OpenSearch for monitoring using observability methods.
